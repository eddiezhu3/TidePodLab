## Hypothesis
The best case scenario is O(n), and the worst case is O(n^2).

## Background
(assessment of Big O's runtime for best case, average case, and worst case)

## Experiment Methodology
A random array will be generated based on size, and the sorting algorithm will be timed while sorting the array. 

## Results 
(time measurements and analysis)

## Conclusions
(analysis of raw data and concise explanations)
(mention any results that are unexplanable"
